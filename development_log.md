# AirPlay Web Interface Development Log

## Project Overview
A Raspberry Pi-based Airplay receiver with a web interface for music playback through IQaudio DAC, designed for seamless audio streaming and local control.

**Stack:**
- Raspberry Pi OS
- Python Flask
- Shairport-Sync
- Chromium Kiosk Mode
- IQaudio DAC hardware

## Development History

### [2025-03-22] Initial Development Log
- Created development log file to track project progress, design decisions and key insights
- Project currently has a Flask web server with routes for health checks and displaying metadata
- Audio control functionality implemented through AudioController class
- Set up infrastructure for reading metadata from shairport-sync
- Added development log update utility script to help maintain consistent progress tracking
- Created update_log.py utility script to simplify maintaining the development log across multiple coding sessions
- Created README.md with comprehensive project overview and instructions for using the development log utility
- Created sync_log.py utility to generate summaries for sharing across multiple assistant conversations
- Updated README with instructions for using sync_log.py utility

## Design Decisions
- Using Flask for the web interface due to its lightweight nature, perfect for Raspberry Pi
- Shairport-sync for AirPlay receiver functionality
- Metadata pipe approach for getting real-time playback information
- Web interface designed to be viewed in kiosk mode for a seamless display experience

## Key Configuration Notes
- Shairport-sync configured to write metadata to a named pipe
- IQaudio DAC requires specific ALSA configuration
- Web interface runs on port 5001 to avoid conflicts
- System services configured for auto-start on boot

## Future Enhancements
- [TBD]
